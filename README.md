# etch-a-sketch

This webpage is a webpage version of something between a sketchpad and an Etch-A-Sketch.

Skills on display:
1. Proficient Git Workflow: Demonstrating proficiency in managing code using Git. I've established a repository on GitHub, cloned it to my local machine, made modifications to the project via local files, and effectively committed and pushed changes using Git commands in my terminal.

2. CSS expertise: Utilizing CSS flex to create a grid layout and implementing hovering effects for an interactive user experience.

3. DOM manipulation: Creating and styling elements dynamically using JavaScript and utilizing 'querySelector()' method effecively.

4. Event listeners - Attaching event listener to a button and prompt the user for a number of square divs in a grid.

Functionality: 
The grid starts with a 16 x 16 grid of square divs. There's a button at the top of the screen that will send the user a popup asking for the number of squares per side for the new grid. Once entered, the existing grid should be removed and a new grid should be generated in the same total space as before (e.g. 960px wide) so that youâ€™ve got a new sketch pad.

Acknowledgment: I would like to express my gratitude to the individuals behind The Odin Project for providing free learning materials for all aspiring web developers.
